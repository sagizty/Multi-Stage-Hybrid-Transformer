# This is the visulization of the attention area of MSHT by the Grad CAM technique.

* Typical results indicate the performance of MSHT: MSHT can distinct samples from its counterparts correctly by a reasonable attention area.

* Some misclassified samples are illustrated to show its limitation:

A few positive samples were misclassified to its negative counterparts.  Comparing with senior pathologists, the small number of the cells made MSHT difficult to distinct cancer cells by its arrangement and relative size information. 

A specific image was misclassified to positive condition by 3 of the 5-fold models. By the analysis of senior pathologist, the reason can be revealed on the fluctuation of the squeezed sample, which mislead MSHT by the shape of the cells.
